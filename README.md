# BeatFormer
A ML Beat Saber map generator.

## Current State

Does not work yet :(

## How to use

Copy the unzipped Beat Saber maps into `./data` to provide training data.
The output maps will be in `./out`.
There is no loading weights implemented yet, this will be done when the model can successfully train.

## Contributing

If you find a way to improve this design, create an issue or pull request so that it can be merged/implemented.
Any contribution is appreciated!

This README will be updated once the code works.
